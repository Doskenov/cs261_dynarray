# A simple dynamic array implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a simple dynamic array for storing `int`s.  The dynamic array is specified in `dynarray.h` and implemented in `dynarray.c`.  There is also a small program in `test_dynarray.c` to demonstrate the dynamic array.  You can compile this program using the provided `Makefile` and run it as follows:
```
make
./test_dynarray
```
